            <h3>Welcome</h3>
            <p>Welcome to auspolASSAY. We offer analysis of the next Australian Federal Election which is due to take place in 2018/2019. Voters will elect members of the 46th Parliament of Australia. The election will be called following the dissolution or expiry of the 45th Parliament as elected at the 2016 double dissolution federal election.</p>

            <h3>The Date</h3>
              <p>An election for the House of Representatives can be called at any time during the three-year parliamentary term. The Constitution of Australia does not require simultaneous elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives, and there are precedents for separate elections. However governments and the electorate have long preferred that elections for the two Houses take place simultaneously in order to limit costs. The last House-only election took place in 1969, and the last Senate-only election took place in 1970.</p>

            <h3>Redistributions</h3>
              <p>Under the new census figures released on 27 June 2017, the Parliamentary Library calculated that under the new numbers, the next election will be held to elect 151 MPs, with one lost in South Australia, and one gain each in Victoria and the ACT.</p>
